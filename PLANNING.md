## Architecture Principles

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Feature-First Structure**

```
app/
├── api/           # Feature-based endpoints
├── services/      # AI and external service integrations
├── models/        # Data models and database entities
├── schemas/       # Request/response validation
├── core/          # Cross-cutting concerns
└── utils/         # Shared utilities
```

**Edge-First Strategy**

-   **Local by default**: OCR, ASR, basic MT for common language pairs
-   **Cloud fallback**: Complex reasoning, long-tail languages, premium features
-   **Performance targets**: <2s speech-to-speech, <1s OCR-to-translation

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Privacy-First Design**

-   Raw audio/video stays on device unless user opts into cloud
-   Anonymous telemetry only (no content logging by default)
-   User control over cloud services with clear toggles
-   Local AES-GCM encryption for stored data

**Security Measures**

-   TLS 1.3 for all network communications
-   Face/Touch ID for sensitive data access
-   Per-feature privacy permissions
-   Regular security audits and updates

### 🌐 Internationalization

**Multilingual Support**

-   **Tier 1**: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese
-   **Tier 2**: Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Arabic
-   **Offline packs**: Downloadable language bundles <250MB each
-   **Cultural adaptation**: Localized politeness patterns, cultural context

### 📱 Platform Strategy

**Backend-First Approach**

-   FastAPI backend as single source of truth
-   RESTful APIs with WebSocket real-time features
-   Mobile apps (React Native/Flutter) consume APIs
-   Web interface for testing and administration

## Development Practices

### 🧪 Quality Standards

**Code Quality**

-   **File size limit**: ≤500 lines per file
-   **Test coverage**: >90% for new features
-   **Type checking**: Full mypy compliance
-   **Linting**: ruff with project-specific rules

**Performance Requirements**

-   **API latency**: P95 <500ms for basic endpoints
-   **Voice pipeline**: P95 <2.2s for speech-to-speech
-   **OCR processing**: P95 <1.2s for 1080p images
-   **Battery efficiency**: <12% drain per 20min continuous use

### 🔄 Development Workflow
